# STA304

Course Content
The course will consider the following overarching themes in statistical theory and data anal-
ysis:

• Designing a survey or sample that is appropriately gathering information of interest.
• Carrying out a variety of statistical analyses in R to make inference on the data collected
from a survey/sample.
• Identifying and implementing different sampling techniques and different study designs
and the trade-offs involved in each.
• Identifying sources of bias within a study and comment on a study’s design, including
its weaknesses, strengths, and appropriate analyses.
• Clearly communicating results of statistical analyses to technical and non-technical au-
diences.
• Understanding best practices and ethical considerations in survey design, sampling, and
observational data collection and analysis.

We will consider various perspectives on these themes, including Bayesian, frequentist, and
likelihood approaches. We will consider methods that rely on mathematical thinking and
methods that rely on computational thinking, with particular emphasis on computational
approaches to analyzing data and understanding statistical methods
